Smile
Smile is a mask

She feels the pain, she feels the gain. In the sorrow she locks herself up with the grief nobody really understands; nobody cares to understand. Yet, she astounds the world with her serene makeup of pseudo-happiness.
She masks her feelings with a smile.
A smile that locks up the world in inspiration.
A smile that the world doesn’t care to devle deeper to understand.
A smile — a heavenly smile upon which the joy, sorrow, mischief, laughter, tears, get mixed down upon the horizon of aspiration.
Smile is a connection
She talks with her family, her friends. She talks with the people around. She talks; she connects mentally. Above all, she talks with her inner self.
In sadness, in happiness — she connects with people pondering about depths of life. Like a moonlight that shines upon the blissful pavement where upon the shadows dance gracefully — the connection between the light and the shadows to showcase a synergy.
That’s why her smile brings a transcendental connection to everyone.
Sometimes, she feels rage; she feels caged. Yet, she doesn’t cease to smile.
A smile that brings joy to the sad ones.
A smile that wipes up the tears.
A smile — a blessing to the near ones, to the dear ones.
But…
In her agony, world laughs at her.
In her sadness, the world mocks her situation.
In her presence, when she smiles, the world fakes a laugh.
Yes! Like people that eats people mentally, the world ignores her smile.
A smile that does magic beyond the rhythms of her voice, her words.
A smile that tries to eradicate the internal conflict — existential crisis.
Yet…
Her smile has left deeper scar in my heart, in my soul. For she’s the only smile that’s left inside of me.

The Pacman Machine I bet you know about the classic Mario game and probably have played it. You are on a quest, moving from levels to levels
in search of a princess that has been kidnapped. You crush all the spooky dogs and flying turtles with the superpowers such as transforming
into giant, shooting out bullets.But hey! On top of the energy of a naive Mario, you seamlessly have played the never-ending game ofPacman—
yes the world where these elusive ghosts chase you (the ultimate player) for the reason that seems mysterious.LustIt’s funny how you move
around the strange two-dimensional world, just for the sake of eating, eating and eating. Yes, the only reason you move is with this
mysterious force to devour everything in the path. You can never get enough of it. In your life, there is always something more you want.
That need never gets quenched. The game is a reflection of lust.Eternal DissatisfactionYour lust never dies. You move from level to level.
Your existence has no meaning. Your life is an endless rush into oblivion. You don’t realize what you have been missing the whole time. You
don’t even dare to stop. Because if you do, the ghosts in your mind devour you completely. There’s always this dissatisfaction in your life
that interrupts the harmony between your soul and the world outside.DesireDesire is something that bounds life itself to the existence. Your
desire for more; more never ends. Money, love, life, and all the chaos. That’s all you think of. You can’t put aside your desires and be
yourself. You can’t really focus on your own “I, Me and Myself” against the world that wants more and more.Levels upon levels upon levels,
your existence thrive upon these uncanny behaviors.AchievementWhile life is chasing you and you are chasing the unknowns, there comes a
point in life where you feel achieved. You feel you can conquer the world. You can triumph over the ghosts in your mind. That satisfaction
of achievement ultimately boosts your inner pride; hence your inner peace is restored. It’s this factor that really factors out all the
negativity in your life.But, again life happens. The achievement; you can’t really get enough of it. Hence, the ultimate cycle
continues:Lust, dissatisfaction, desire and achievement makes you who you should be.
